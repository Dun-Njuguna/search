This project has been written in programming languages, like HTML which is used to create the basic skeleton of the pages and CSS which is used to style it.This languages ore dependent on each other in order for a web app to appear fully backed.
The logical part of the application is created out of typescript, which is used to collect users queries.

### 1.CSS(Cascading style sheet)
Css is used to style there appearance of website on the web. Thus this project was a good exercise to help me understand how best to style a page. The project also tested my ability to use an external cascading style sheet for the whole project.

### 2.Use of version control
It is important that when collaborating or doing an independent project to be able to track the changes and revert to a previous stable state in case of the local copy being damaged.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.1.
